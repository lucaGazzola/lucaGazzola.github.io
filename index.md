I'm Luca Gazzola, a PhD student in software engineering at University of Milano-Bicocca, supervised by prof. Leonardo Mariani. I obtained my MSc degree from University of Milano-Bicocca with a thesis on automatic software testing of java software using evolutionary algorithms. My focus is software testing but I am also interested in automatic software repair, machine learning and mobile software development.
