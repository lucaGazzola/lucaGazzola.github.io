# About Me

I'm a software engineer in test at [lastminute.com](https://www.lastminute.com). I obtained my PhD degree from University of Milano-Bicocca, working with prof. Leonardo Mariani and his group, with a thesis on field testing of Java applications and authoring several reasearch articles. My research focus has always been software testing but I am also interested in automatic software repair, machine learning and software development in general.
