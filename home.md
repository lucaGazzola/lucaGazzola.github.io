# About Me

Hi! I am a software engineer with prior experience in software testing automation. During my academic experience (PhD, supervised by prof. Leonardo Mariani), I developed an evolutionary algorithm for the automatic generation of test suites and a methodology for testing Java applications in real-world scenarios, utilizing user input and general oracles. Currently, my focus lies in product development, although I have previously contributed to projects involving end-to-end testing automation and performance testing. My interests also extend to automatic software repair. I have authored multiple scientific articles, which have been published in top software engineering journals and conferences.

When my hands are off the keyboard, I love reading (both fiction and non-fiction), riding my bikes (with or without engine) but sometimes I also get back to the keyboard to play some videogames!
