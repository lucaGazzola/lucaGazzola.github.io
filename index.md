# About Me

Hi! I am a software engineer with prior experience in software testing automation. During my academic experience (PhD, supervised by prof. Leonardo Mariani) I have authored multiple scientific articles, which have been published in top software engineering journals and conferences. Currently, my focus lies in product development, although I have previously contributed to projects involving end-to-end testing automation and performance testing. My interests also extend to automatic software repair.

When my hands are off the keyboard, I love reading (both fiction and non-fiction), riding my bikes (with or without engine) but sometimes I also get back to the keyboard to play some videogames!
